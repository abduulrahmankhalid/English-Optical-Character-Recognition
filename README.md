# English-Optical-Character-Recognition
English OCR With Emnist Dataset Using Random Forests and Decision Trees

The repository is a part of course work for CS 361 Artificial Intelligence - FCAI-HU

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the automated

conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-
encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document,
a scene-photo (e.g., the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from
subtitle text superimposed on an image (e.g., from a television broadcast).
Our project takes the [EMNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist), processing it and recognizing the
character through 2 algorithms which are Decision Trees, Random Forests.
